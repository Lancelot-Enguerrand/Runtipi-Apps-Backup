# ‚õ∫Ô∏è Runtipi Apps Backup Script üíæ
Script for backing up Runtipi apps data with retention policy.
> [!WARNING]  
> Runtipi v4 and further needs script v2

## How to use ?
I suggest to refer directly into runtipi official guides here : [runtipi.io/docs](https://runtipi.io/docs/guides/auto-backup-apps)  
Thanks to [Stavros](https://github.com/steveiliop56) for documentation and publishing. ü§©

### ‚úçÔ∏è Define values (inside script)
###### ‚õ∫Ô∏è runtipi path *(line 9)*
You need to set your `runtipiPath` inside the script to point to your actual Runtipi path.
###### üóì retention *(line 15-18)*
Retention policy is defined in script and is 3 by default, you can change it to your own convenience :
```bash
dailyRetention=3
weeklyRetention=3
monthlyRetention=3
yearlyRetention=3
```
This define the number of files that will be kept for each type of backup.
### ‚öôÔ∏è Arguments

| Accepted Values                     | Description                                                                                                        | Default | Required |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `daily`,`weekly`,`monthly`,`yearly` | Set the name of the final backup, for example if you use `daily` the backup name will be `myapp-daily-date.tar.gz` | `daily` | no       |
| `stop`,`ignore`                     | Stop the app before backing up or backup anyway.                                                                   | `stop`  | no       |

[deprecated]: <>  (| `path`                     | Specify a path to a file describing what apps you want to backup, each app id in a new line.                       | `none`  | no       |)

### ‚è∞ Cron example
You will need a job scheduler to execute the script accordingly with your backup strategy, 2 examples with Cron below :

üë∂ Basic examples with daily, weekly, monthly and yearly
```bash
# Every day at 2 AM - daily
0 2 * * * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh daily

# Every Monday at 3 AM - weekly
0 3 * * 1 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh weekly

# Every 1st day of the month at 4 AM - monthly
0 4 1 * * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh monthly

# Every 1st day of January at 5 AM - yearly
0 5 1 1 * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh yearly
```

ü§ì Advanced configuration avoiding to perform 2 backups the same day *(unless the 1st day of the month is a monday)*
```bash
# Every day from Tuesday to Sunday at 2 AM - daily
0 2 * * 2-7 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh daily

# Every Monday at 2 AM - weekly
0 2 * * 1 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh weekly

# Every 1st day of the month from February to December at 3 AM - monthly
0 3 1 2-12 * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh monthly

# Every 1st day of January at 3 AM - yearly
0 3 1 1 * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh yearly
```

## ‚ú® How to restore an app ?
Simply use the restore functionnality from Runtipi WebUI.  
*My Apps* &rarr; *AppName* &rarr; *Backups*  
Choose your desired backup and select **Restore**

## ü§î Considered enhancements
1. Restoration Script : It was initially planned but built-in runtipi backup functionnality made it feel unnecessary.
2. Check if the restored app has been stopped correctly
3. Reference List to choose which to backup has been removed but it could be replaced with a whitelist/blacklist system
4. Using Runtipi built-in functionalities : Runtipi is growing and may add backup support in runtipi-cli, it could probably even make this script obsolete in the future.
